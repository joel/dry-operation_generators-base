# Operation Generators

Operation Generators is a utility library designed to create all the needed file for handling an operation with Dry RB ecosystem by automating the creation of a comprehensive set of files required for new Business Logic actions.

Reducing manual boilerplate code and enforcing a unified code structure enhances productivity and consistency while minimizing the potential for errors.

The following files are generated for the action `Create` of the resource `User`:

```shell
app/operations/users/create/
├── action.rb
├── contract.rb
├── operation.rb
├── register.rb
├── repository.rb
├── schema.rb
└── validation.rb
```

For those files, we need their test counterpart.

```shell
test/operations/users/create/
├── acction_test.rb
├── contract_test.rb
├── operation_test.rb
├── register_test.rb
├── repository_test.rb
├── schema_test.rb
└── validation_test.rb
```

Please check out [TestUnit Generators](https://github.com/orgs/joel/dry-operation_generators-test_unit)

The generator helps to reduce the burden and lower the boilerplate of adding a new action. On top of that, it helps reduce typos and make code more unified.

It aims to speed up the development.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem "dry-operation_generators-base", require: "operations/base"
  gem "dry-operation_generators"
  gem "dry-operation_generators-rspec" # or gem "dry-operation_generators-test_unit"
end
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can print out the Rails Generators Help:

```shell
rails generate --help
```

The following Generators should appear:

```shell
Operations:
  operations:action
  operations:contract
  operations:operation
  operations:register
  operations:repository
  operations:schema
  operations:validation
```

You can print the help for any generator:

```shell
rails generate operations:<generator name> --help
```

To generate all at once use scaffold:

```shell
Operations:
  operations:scaffold
```

### Install Generator

The `install` generator needs to be run to install the shared files, such as `app/operations/application_contract.rb` of `app/operations/application_schema.rb`.

### Scaffold Generator

The `scaffold` generator calls all the generators at once.

```shell
rails generate operations:scaffold user create firstname:string{optional}
      create  app/operations/users/create/action.rb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/app/operations/users/create/contract_test.rb
      create  app/operations/users/base/contract.rb
      create  app/operations/users/create/contract.rb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/app/operations/users/create/schema_test.rb
      create  app/operations/users/base/schema.rb
      create  app/operations/users/create/schema.rb
      create  app/operations/users/create/validation.rb
      create  app/operations/users/create/repository.rb
      create  app/operations/users/create/register.rb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/app/operations/users/create/operation_test.rb
      create  app/operations/users/create/operation.rb
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

There is a generator of generators you can use to quickly add a new generator:

```shell
./bin/generator <generator name> --no-dry_run
```

That provides the skeleton for the new generator. Note that the test suite should still run after the generated files.
